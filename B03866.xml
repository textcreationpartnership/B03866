            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter it pleased Almighty God to take to his Mercy, the Late King, my Dearest Brother, and to bring Me to the Peaceable Possession of the Throne of My Ancestors; I immediately Resolved to Call a Parliament, as the best Means to Settle every Thing upon those Foundations that may make my Reign both Easie and Happy to you, towards which I am Disposed to Contribute all that is Fit for Me to do; What I said to My Privy Council at My first Coming there, I am desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to Renew to you; Wherein I fully Declared My Opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whose Members have shewed themselves so Eminently Loyal in the Worst of Times, In Defence of my Father, and Support of My Brother, of Blessed Memory, That I will always take Care to Defend and Support it: I will make it My Endeavour to Preserve this Government both in Church and State, as it is now by Law Established; and as I will never Depart from the Just Rights and Prerogative of the Crown, So I will never Invade any Mans Property; And you may be sure, That having heretofore Ventured My Life in the Defence of this Nation, I shall still Go as far as any Man in Preserving it in all it's Just Rights and Liberties. And having Given you this Assurance concerning the Care I will have of your Religion and Property, which I have chosen to do in the same Words I used at My first Coming to the Crown, the better to Evidence to you That I Spoke Them not by chance, and consequently, That you may the more Firmly Rely upon a Promise so Solemnly Made; I cannot Doubt that I shall fail of Sutable Returns from you, with all imaginable Duty and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:178817:4"/> Kindness on your Part, and particularly, In what relates to the Settling of my Revenue, and Continuing it during My Life, as it was in the Time of the King My Brother: I might Use many Arguments to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this Demand, from the Benefit of Trade, The Support of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, The Necessity of the Crown, and the Well-being of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it self, which I must not suffer to be Precarious; But I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, your own Consideration of what is Just and Reasonable, will Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest to you whatsoever might be Enlarged upon this Occasion. There is one Popular Argument, which I foresee may be used against what I Ask of you, from the Inclination Men may have for frequent Parliaments, which some may think would be the best Secured, by Feeding Me from Time to Time, by such Proportions as they shall think convenient; And this Argument, It being the First Time I Speak to you from the Throne, I will answer Once for All: That this would be a very improper Method to Take with Me, and, That the best Way to Engage Me to Meet you Often is, Always to Use Me well; I Expect therefore, That you will Comply with Me in what I have Desired, and, That you will Do it Speedily, That this may be a short Session, and that We may Meet again to all Our Satisfactions.</p>
